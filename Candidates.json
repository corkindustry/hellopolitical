      "bio":"Suzanne Miles (born 1970) is a Republican politician from her native Owensboro, Kentucky, who represents the 7th District (Daviess, Henderson, and Union counties) in the Kentucky House of Representatives.  Miles won her position in a special election held on December 10, 2013. She defeated the Democrat Kim Humphrey of Morganfield in Union County, 3,548 (50.8 percent) to 3,436 votes (49.2 percent). Miles's narrowly victory was propelled by her strong showing in her own Daviess County in western Kentucky, where she and her father, Billy Joe Miles, are well known. She beat Humphrey 2,564 to 976 in Daviess County.  The seat opened when the Democrat John Arnold, Jr., of Sturgis in Union County resigned in September amid allegations that he had sexually harassed legislative staffers.[2] Arnold had won the seat by only five votes over the Republican Tim Kline in the general election held on November 6, 2012.  Prior to her election to the legislature, Miles had been a district representative for U.S. Representative Brett Guthrie of Kentucky's 2nd congressional district. Miles became the 46th Republican in the Kentucky House, the highest strength her minority party has held in the chamber since 1921.",
